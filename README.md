# Labor Market Model with Binding Wage Floor

This Python implementation models a perfectly competitive labor market with a binding wage floor and dynamic adjustment over time.

## Model Description

The model assumes:
- Labor markets are perfectly competitive
- Labor supply is upward sloping and fixed over time
- A binding wage floor $\bar{w}$ is imposed such that $\bar{w} > w^*$
- Over time, firms adjust to the wage floor through capital substitution, automation, or exit, modeled as an inward shift of labor demand
